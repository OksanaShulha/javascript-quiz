<!--

  These will be the main types of tasks in the quiz project:
    `type: components`
    `type: css`
    `type: logic`
    `type: handlers`


  Some general changes you will need to make:
  - client/data/quiz.js (to add questions)
  - client/config.js (to configure your repo name for deployment)

  For each user story you may need to write code in:
  - client/src/components
  - client/src/handlers
  - client/src/logic
  - client/styles
  - client/public

  everything else should work already!
